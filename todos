#FIX: Stripped rendering effect (strange lines behaviour)

# Maybe we could separate collision hitboxes and action hitboxes by making sub-classes
# As collision hitboxes' commands are not meant to ever be triggered
#     and action hitboxes gets no benefits in also being a collision one
# that would lighten the code from it's many generated hitboxes that all have a empty command
#
# Idk i was just thinking smth like that
#
# Good one ! we might keep it for later (when we'll optimize this code)
